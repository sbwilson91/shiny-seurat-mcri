Generate a shiny app primarily for looking at previously curated single cell data with Seurat.
once this is developed, can think about including a QC component as well.

Basics of app:

Input to load dataset
TSNE plot showing clusters (possibly changable between clustering resolutions, animations?)
Option to include the clustree images as well (the linked levels graph, cluster changes across resolution)
DE list for all clusters, individual clusters, positive/negative logFC, p values
Heatmap

Way to select previously identified OR custom generation of gene lists for analysis in heatmaps, dotplots etc.

way to subset individual/groups of clusters
will probably need to put this in a seperate tab, and have input for what clusters to seperate and same displays as main page
